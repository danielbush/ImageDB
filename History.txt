* First version of Image DB written; we can break it up like so:
  * CRUD operations
    * store original
    * update original and sized images
    * delete original and sized images
    * fetching/resolving
      * fetch location of image with option to resolve
        to a http alias (or alternative root)
      * autogeneration of sized images
  * Resolving
    * resolve/absolute functions resolve names
      but don't check existence
  * Querying and listing
    * DB#image details about original and its size images;
      DB#images to search on originals; use grep.
      DB#glob to use shell wildcards.
  * Hierarchical
    * Ability to store new hierarchical db's within the parent
      * DB#[group_name]
      * DB#groups to list groups
