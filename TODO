* Fetch should call all creation/resize hooks since it
  does all the work
  * pass in a method name call if you want to track
    which method called fetch
* At least, clean up the hook interface; update may
  or may not pass an array of sized images etc - this is
  just a bit messy.

* An interface to make ruby-db language agnostic
  * distributed ruby
  * REST
* Use of bin/convert and bin/identify; we need to allow
  for RMagick which would be more scalable.
* Review what we return and how we error.
  * do we return path on deletes and updates? should it
    be resolved or just the image name
  * hooks and errors; if hook has error...  ; if db has error...
