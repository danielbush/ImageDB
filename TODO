[21-Jun-2010] [DB]
* An interface to make ruby-db language agnostic
  * distributed ruby
  * REST
* Use of bin/convert and bin/identify; we need to allow
  for RMagick which would be more scalable.
* Review what we return and how we error.
  * do we return path on deletes and updates? should it
    be resolved or just the image name
  * hooks and errors; if hook has error...  ; if db has error...
